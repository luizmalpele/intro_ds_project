## Section 1. Introduction/Motivation

- The objective of our project is to predict the percentage of students who will complete online courses provided at MIT and Harvard. After identifying what variables have more explanatory power, this information will be helpful to see which courses students will most likely complete and possibly change some of the course material to help students avoid dropping out of the course.

## Section 2. Data Analysis Plan

- Online courses of Harvard and MIT: The data fields included are: institution, course_number, launch_day, course, instructures, subject, year, honor_certificate, participants, half_completed, completed, half_completed_ratio, completed_ratio, completed_given_half_ratio, played_video_ratio, posted_forum_ratio, grade_above_zero, course_hours, hours_certification_median, age_median, male_ratio, female_ratio, bachelor_ratio, subject_cs, subject_gov, subject_hum, subject_stem, ln_participants, ln_completed_ratio

- Data visualization on the performance of students based on grade level and major. 

- Data visualization on the completion of the courses based on the available attributes.


## Section 3. Data Description

- We are utilizing the `harvardMIT.csv` dataset available at 
<https://github.com/reisanar/datasets/blob/master/harvardMIT.csv>

- We have 29 attributes and 8,294 observations.
