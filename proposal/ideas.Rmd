## Section 1. Introduction/Motivation

The objective of our project is to predict the percentage of people who will complete the online courses. After identifying what variables have more explanatory power, this information will be helpful to suggest courses that students will most likely complete and also change the material of some of the courses to help students avoid dropping out at the end.

## Section 2. Data Analysis Plan

- Online courses of Harvard and MIT: The data fields included are: institution, course_number, launch_day, course, instructures, subject, year, honor_certificate, participants, half_completed, completed, half_completed_ratio, completed_ratio, completed_given_half_ratio, played_video_ratio, posted_forum_ratio, grade_above_zero, course_hours, hours_certification_median, age_median, male_ratio, female_ratio, bachelor_ratio, subject_cs, subject_gov, subject_hum, subject_stem, ln_participants, ln_completed_ratio

- Data visualization on the performance of students based on grade level and major. 

- Data visualization on the completion of the courses based on the available attributes.


## Section 3. Data Description

- We use the `harvardMIT.csv` dataset available at 
<https://github.com/reisanar/datasets/blob/master/harvardMIT.csv>
